### About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Wole a **compyter science student** currently enrolled in the **ALX Software Engineering program**, with a strong focus on **backend development**.

ðŸ”§ I enjoy working with technologies like **Python, Flask, SQL,** and a bit of **JavaScript**, and Iâ€™m constantly improving my skills in **Backend development** and **database management**. While I'm more comfortable working on the backend, Iâ€™ve been pushing myself to grow in **frontend development** by working on projects that involve creating full-stack applications.

ðŸ’» Currently, Iâ€™m interning at the **Lagos State Land Administration e-GIS Portal**, where I focus on **gathering data** for various projects. 
```Some of my ongoing projects include:```
- **Video Game Portfolio Website** â€“ utilizing the **RAWG API** and Flask.
- Web scraping projects and data-driven applications.
  
ðŸš€ I'm always eager to collaborate on open-source projects and build useful tools.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about tech!
